A
simple
text
scanner
which
can
parse
primitive
types
and
strings
using
regular
expressions.
A
Scanner
breaks
its
input
into
tokens!
using
a
delimiter
pattern?
which
by
default
matches
whitespace.
The
resulting
tokens
may
then
be
converted
into
values
of
different
types
using
the
various
next
methods.
For
example,
this
code
allows
a
user
to
read
a
number
from
System.in:

>>> ===================================== <<<
 + Total number of words: 60
>>> ===================================== <<<
